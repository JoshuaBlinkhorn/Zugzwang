# Figure out how to unit test this class.
# Is it sufficiently high-level that these tests can be considered automated
# integration tests? They will likely need to open and save files, and check their
# content. So we need to figure out how to make these processes backwards compatible,
# as the .chp standard format will certainly expand.
