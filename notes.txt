Notes on revamping chessic 24-06-2022

We should put the archived version into a new git repository and
give it a new name.
Then we should start to use it as it to train the Grunfeld.

At the same time, clone it somewhere else and create branches for
the following upgrades:

1) Replaced constants with an enum
2) Subclass Board and put the printing functions into that class.
   Also write unit tests for that class.
3) Create the whole OOP architecture class by class, from the
   inside out. So we should have classes like:
   - Problem, Solution, which subclass Node
   - Card
   - Item, Collection, Category
   - MainMenu, CollectionMenu, CategoryMenu which subclass Menuxo

I'm going to do 2, creating my own board class, and write unit tests
at the same time.
So we need a venv.
